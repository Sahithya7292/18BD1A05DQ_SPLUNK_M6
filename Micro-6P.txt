(know version)

-> docker images
(to check if any images are present or not)

-> docker pull splunk/splunk:latest
(install splunk/splunk image's latest version)

-> docker network create --driver bridge --attachable kmit
(create a network -  a hexadecimal code is generated)

-> docker run --network kmit --name splunkE --hostname splunkE -p 8001:8000 -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=administrator" -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -it splunk/splunk:latest

-> docker pull splunk/universalforwarder:latest

-> docker run --network kmit --name SUF --hostname SUF -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=administrator" -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_STANDALONE_URL=splunkE" -it splunk/universalforwarder:latest

-> Open http://localhost:8001/
(Enter the password which you have specified in run command of the respective network and any username you wish And then click Sign In

1. Check Logs
	Recent entry
	IP Address's(VPN)- VPN also stores original address
	Time Stamp
Logs - Read only Persmission(files) unless super admin
Write password
connect to email
pendrive is linked[5 factor login system]
Deleting log files is difficult if it has read only permission
2. Read Events
	Day/Months/Years of time
3. Remedies provided by tool SIEM - Security Information and 
Event Management
	Elastic-2
	OSSec-8
	Splunk-90
Forensic tools
Standard - can't record Credit card details
/*kms server - windows activated*/

all 3 OS
(disdvantages)VM Ware 
-Partitionating memory(RAM)
-Inter Communication Issue[high degree configurtions]
-unnecessay functionalities are working at background
other than VM use Docker

Docker
-Provides same functionality as VM
-Library / files required to run - Linux
-RAM is freed efficiency increases
-one tool one block can't install any other

SPLUNK(Mostly used - EASY)
Captures , Indexes , Correlates Real-Time Data
Searchable repository = graphs, reports, alerts, dashboard, visualizations etc.

#########
1.Create Docker Account and download Docker Desktop
@Not enough memory to run Docker = Goto settings and decrese the memory and CPU Levels
2.Create an account in Splunk - useful if want to downoad any tools in splunk(created using docker)
3.Create account in tryhackme.com(Try the excersises on large data set)
